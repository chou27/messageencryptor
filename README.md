# Message Encryptor

## Description
This Python program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Fernet encryption algorithm from the `cryptography` library. It generates a key, encrypts a user-provided message, and then decrypts the encrypted message back to its original form.

## Features
- Generate encryption key
- Encrypt messages
- Decrypt encrypted messages

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required `cryptography` module by running:

pip install cryptography


## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the program using the following command:
python main.py

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt and decrypt messages.
